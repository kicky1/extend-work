  keyTakeaways: [
    'Lead with certifications — SHRM-CP, SHRM-SCP, PHR, or SPHR — as they serve as immediate credibility signals that many HR director roles require.',
    'Quantify your talent acquisition impact: time-to-fill, cost-per-hire, offer acceptance rates, and quality-of-hire metrics.',
    'Demonstrate compliance expertise by referencing specific regulations (EEOC, FMLA, ADA, FLSA) and the outcomes of your compliance programs.',

      title: 'Leading with HR Certifications and Credentials',
      body: `<p>HR certifications serve as immediate filters in the hiring process. Many senior HR roles list SHRM-SCP or SPHR as required qualifications, and recruiters scan for these before reading further.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>SHRM-CP / SHRM-SCP:</strong> The most widely recognized HR certifications. Place them after your name: "Maria Rodriguez, SHRM-SCP." The SCP signals strategic-level competency.</li>
  <li><strong>PHR / SPHR (HRCI):</strong> The Professional in Human Resources and Senior Professional in Human Resources certifications remain highly valued, especially in the US market.</li>
  <li><strong>Specialized certifications:</strong> CEBS (Certified Employee Benefits Specialist), CDR (Certified Diversity Recruiter), AIRS certifications — these differentiate you for specialized HR functions.</li>
  <li><strong>In-progress credentials:</strong> If preparing for an exam, state it clearly: "SHRM-SCP — exam scheduled March 2025." This shows intentional professional development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond certifications, mention continuing education in employment law, organizational development, or compensation strategy. HR is a field where regulatory landscapes shift frequently, and ongoing learning is expected.</p>`,
      tip: 'If you hold both SHRM and HRCI certifications, list both. Dual certification is uncommon and immediately distinguishes you from other candidates.',

      title: 'Quantifying Talent Acquisition and Retention Impact',
      body: `<p>HR managers are ultimately measured by their ability to <strong>attract, retain, and develop talent</strong>. Your resume must convert these activities into measurable outcomes.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Talent acquisition metrics:</strong> "Reduced average time-to-fill from 52 days to 34 days across 120 annual requisitions while maintaining a 92% offer acceptance rate."</li>
  <li><strong>Cost efficiency:</strong> "Decreased cost-per-hire by 28% ($2,400 to $1,730) by implementing an employee referral program that generated 35% of all hires."</li>
  <li><strong>Retention:</strong> "Designed and launched a new onboarding program that improved 90-day retention from 78% to 93%, saving an estimated $420K in annual turnover costs."</li>
  <li><strong>Employee engagement:</strong> "Led the annual engagement survey (1,400 respondents), achieved a 12-point improvement in eNPS from 22 to 34 over 18 months."</li>
  <li><strong>Workforce planning:</strong> "Built a succession planning framework for 45 critical roles, reducing leadership vacancy duration by 60%."</li>
</ul>
<p>Always connect your metrics to business impact. A retention improvement is good; a retention improvement that saved $420K in replacement costs is compelling. HR leaders who speak the language of finance earn seats at the executive table.</p>`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Demonstrating Compliance and Employment Law Expertise',
      body: `<p>Employment law compliance is a non-negotiable competency for HR managers. Your resume should reference the specific regulations you navigate and the compliance outcomes you deliver.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Federal regulations:</strong> EEOC (Title VII, ADA, ADEA), FMLA, FLSA (overtime and wage classifications), COBRA, HIPAA, OSHA, WARN Act. Name the ones relevant to your experience.</li>
  <li><strong>State and local laws:</strong> Pay transparency laws, ban-the-box legislation, state-specific leave requirements. "Ensured compliance with California's pay transparency law (SB 1162) across 280 job postings."</li>
  <li><strong>Investigations:</strong> "Conducted 35+ workplace investigations covering harassment, discrimination, and policy violations, achieving resolution within an average of 14 business days."</li>
  <li><strong>Audit outcomes:</strong> "Prepared for and passed DOL audits in 2023 and 2024 with zero findings. Maintained FLSA-compliant classification for 600+ employees across 3 states."</li>
  <li><strong>Policy development:</strong> "Authored the company's first comprehensive employee handbook (120 pages), approved by outside counsel and rolled out to 1,800 employees."</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've navigated complex scenarios — workforce reductions, union negotiations, multi-state compliance — highlight these. They signal experience with high-stakes HR work that cannot be taught in a classroom.</p>`,
      tip: 'Mention specific training programs you developed or facilitated: anti-harassment, unconscious bias, manager compliance training. Include completion rates and any measurable behavior changes that resulted.',
    },
    {
      title: 'HRIS Systems and HR Technology Proficiency',
      body: `<p>Modern HR management is deeply intertwined with technology. Your resume should demonstrate that you can leverage HR information systems to drive efficiency, analytics, and employee experience.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Core HRIS platforms:</strong> Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, ADP Workforce Now, BambooHR, UKG (UltiPro/Kronos), Paylocity, Ceridian Dayforce. Specify which modules you've administered.</li>
  <li><strong>ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems):</strong> Greenhouse, Lever, iCIMS, Workable, Taleo. "Configured Greenhouse with custom scorecards and structured interview kits for 8 departments."</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation experience:</strong> "Led the migration from ADP to Workday for a 2,000-employee organization, completing data migration, UAT, and go-live within 6 months, on budget."</li>
  <li><strong>People analytics:</strong> "Built Power BI dashboards tracking attrition risk, compensation equity, and headcount forecasting, presented monthly to the C-suite."</li>
  <li><strong>Learning management systems:</strong> Cornerstone, Bridge, Docebo — relevant if you manage training and development programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have experience selecting, implementing, or migrating HRIS platforms, dedicate a full bullet to it. System implementation projects demonstrate project management capability, cross-functional leadership, and change management skills simultaneously.</p>`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Highlighting DEI, Culture, and Organizational Development',
      body: `<p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and culture-building are increasingly central to the HR function. Your resume should demonstrate <strong>strategic initiatives with measurable outcomes</strong>, not just program names.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DEI metrics:</strong> "Launched a structured interviewing program and diverse slate requirement that increased underrepresented group representation in management from 18% to 31% over 2 years."</li>
  <li><strong>Employee resource groups:</strong> "Established and sponsored 5 ERGs with a combined 400 members, securing a $120K annual budget and executive sponsorship."</li>
  <li><strong>Culture programs:</strong> "Designed a recognition and rewards program (peer-nominated) that achieved 78% monthly participation and correlated with a 9-point eNPS improvement."</li>
  <li><strong>Learning and development:</strong> "Built a management development program (6-month cohort model) that graduated 45 first-time managers, with 89% promoted within 18 months."</li>
</ul>
<p>Be concrete and data-driven. Generic statements like "passionate about diversity" carry no weight. Hiring organizations want to see what you built, how you measured it, and what changed as a result.</p>`,
      tip: 'If you led compensation equity audits, include the scope (number of employees analyzed) and the corrective actions taken. Pay equity is a high-stakes topic and demonstrating experience with it signals senior-level capability.',

  checklist: [
    'SHRM-CP, SHRM-SCP, PHR, or SPHR certification displayed in resume header',
    'Professional summary specifies HR specialization and size of workforce managed',
    'Talent acquisition metrics quantified: time-to-fill, cost-per-hire, offer acceptance rate, quality of hire',

  commonMistakes: [
    'Using vague language like "managed employee relations" without specifying the scope — how many employees, what types of issues, and what outcomes were achieved.',
    'Omitting certifications from the resume header — SHRM and HRCI credentials are the first thing hiring managers filter for, and burying them in a bottom section is a missed opportunity.',
    'Focusing exclusively on administrative tasks (payroll processing, benefits enrollment) without demonstrating strategic contributions to talent strategy, organizational design, or culture development.',
    'Listing compliance regulations as skills without providing examples of compliance outcomes — knowing what FMLA is matters less than demonstrating you successfully managed FMLA programs for a multi-state workforce.',
    'Neglecting to quantify the business impact of HR programs — retention improvements, cost savings, productivity gains — which are essential for demonstrating HR\'s value as a strategic function.',
