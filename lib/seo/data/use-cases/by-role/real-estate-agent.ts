      title: 'Structuring Licensing and Professional Designations',
      body: `<p>Real estate is a licensed profession, and brokerages verify licensing status before any interview. Your credentials must be <strong>immediately visible</strong> at the top of your resume.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place your license type and designations after your name: "Jessica Park, REALTOR, CRS, ABR." Distinguish between salesperson and broker licenses — a broker's license signals legal authority, experience, and often higher commission splits.</li>
  <li>Create a "License & Designations" section listing: active license with state and number, license type (salesperson vs. broker), NAR designations (CRS, ABR, GRI, SRES, SRS), and any specialty certifications (CIPS for international, MRP for military relocation).</li>
  <li>If you hold licenses in multiple states, list all of them. Cross-border expertise is valuable in metro areas that span state lines (DC/MD/VA, NYC/NJ/CT, Kansas City MO/KS).</li>
  <li>Include continuing education highlights if they demonstrate specialization: "Completed 45-hour luxury home marketing certification through the Institute for Luxury Home Marketing."</li>
</ul>
<p>Never list an expired or inactive license. If you are transferring your license to a new state through reciprocity, note the expected activation date.</p>`,
      tip: 'The CRS (Certified Residential Specialist) designation is held by fewer than 3% of REALTORS. If you have it, make sure it is prominent — it is one of the strongest credibility signals in residential real estate.',

      title: 'Quantifying Sales Performance and Transaction History',
      body: `<p>Real estate hiring decisions are driven by numbers. Brokerages want producers, and your resume must <strong>prove production with hard metrics</strong>, not vague claims about being a "top agent."</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transaction volume:</strong> "Closed $28.4M in residential sales across 47 transactions in 2024, ranking in the top 5% of agents within the brokerage's 400-agent office."</li>
  <li><strong>List-to-sale ratio:</strong> "Achieved a 98.7% average list-to-sale price ratio across seller representations, compared to the market average of 96.2%."</li>
  <li><strong>Days on market:</strong> "Average days on market of 14 for seller listings, 40% below the MLS area average of 23 days."</li>
  <li><strong>Client volume:</strong> "Managed a pipeline of 15-20 active buyer clients simultaneously while maintaining a 4.9/5.0 average client satisfaction rating on Zillow."</li>
  <li><strong>Growth trajectory:</strong> "Grew annual transaction volume from $4.2M (Year 1) to $28.4M (Year 4) through systematic referral network development and geographic farming."</li>
</ul>
<p>If your brokerage provides production awards or tier rankings (Keller Williams Capstone, RE/MAX Platinum, Coldwell Banker International President's Circle), include them. These are industry-recognized benchmarks that hiring managers understand immediately.</p>`,

      title: 'Demonstrating Market Expertise and Specialization',
      body: `<p>Generalist agents are common. What brokerages and teams want are agents with <strong>deep knowledge of specific markets, property types, or client segments</strong> that align with their business strategy.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Geographic specialization:</strong> "Primary market expert in Chicago's North Shore suburbs (Winnetka, Wilmette, Glencoe, Kenilworth) with 60+ transactions closed in the area over 4 years."</li>
  <li><strong>Property type focus:</strong> "Specialize in luxury waterfront properties ($1.5M-$8M price range) with expertise in dock permitting, flood zone insurance, and waterfront-specific inspection issues."</li>
  <li><strong>Client segment expertise:</strong> "Built a practice focused on first-time homebuyers, guiding 85+ clients through FHA, VA, and conventional financing processes with a 95% closing rate on accepted offers."</li>
  <li><strong>Investment property knowledge:</strong> "Advised real estate investors on portfolio acquisitions totaling 32 multifamily units, including cap rate analysis, 1031 exchange coordination, and property management placement."</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have development or commercial crossover experience — land acquisition, zoning applications, commercial lease negotiations — include it. These skills expand your value proposition beyond traditional residential transactions.</p>`,
      tip: 'Mention specific MLS systems you work with (MRED, Stellar MLS, CRMLS, Bright MLS). Brokerages operating across MLS boundaries value agents who can navigate multiple systems.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Highlighting Technology, Marketing, and CRM Proficiency',
      body: `<p>Modern real estate is a technology-driven business. Brokerages invest heavily in tech stacks and want agents who can <strong>leverage tools for lead generation, client management, and listing marketing</strong> without hand-holding.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CRM systems:</strong> List specific platforms: Follow Up Boss, kvCORE, LionDesk, Wise Agent, Salesforce, or HubSpot. Note if you've built automated drip campaigns, pipeline workflows, or lead scoring systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Listing marketing:</strong> "Created and managed listing marketing campaigns including professional photography coordination, Matterport 3D tours, drone videography, single-property websites, and targeted Facebook/Instagram ad campaigns with 3-5x ROAS."</li>
  <li><strong>Digital presence:</strong> "Maintained a real estate blog generating 8,000+ monthly organic visitors, producing 15-20 inbound buyer leads per month through SEO-optimized neighborhood guides."</li>
  <li><strong>Transaction management:</strong> Dotloop, SkySlope, DocuSign, Brokermint, or proprietary brokerage platforms. "Managed 100% paperless transaction workflows using Dotloop, reducing average closing timeline by 3 days."</li>
</ul>
<p>If you run paid advertising, include spend and results: "Managed a $2,500/month Google Ads budget generating 40+ leads per month at $62 cost per lead, converting 8% to closed transactions." Brokerages want agents who understand marketing ROI.</p>`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Showcasing Negotiation Outcomes and Client Advocacy',
      body: `<p>Negotiation is the core skill that separates productive agents from order-takers. Your resume should include <strong>specific examples of negotiation wins</strong> that demonstrate your ability to advocate effectively for clients.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Buyer-side wins:</strong> "Negotiated $45,000 below asking price on a competitive property by leveraging inspection findings and comparable sales data, saving the buyer 6.2% on purchase price."</li>
  <li><strong>Seller-side strategy:</strong> "Implemented a 'coming soon' marketing strategy generating 12 showing requests before MLS listing, resulting in 5 offers and a final sale price 4% above list."</li>
  <li><strong>Complex transactions:</strong> "Successfully closed a short sale requiring coordination with 2 lien holders, an HOA, and a relocation company over a 7-month negotiation period."</li>
  <li><strong>Client retention and referrals:</strong> "Generated 65% of annual business from past client referrals and sphere of influence, with an NPS score of 92 across 200+ surveyed clients."</li>
</ul>
<p>Include testimonial metrics if available: number of 5-star reviews on Zillow, Google, or Realtor.com, client satisfaction survey scores, or referral percentages. Social proof is as important in a resume as it is in a listing presentation.</p>`,
      tip: 'If you have experience training or mentoring newer agents, include it. Team leads and managing brokers specifically seek agents who can contribute to brokerage culture while producing.',

  checklist: [
    'Active real estate license displayed in header with license type (salesperson vs. broker)',
    'NAR designations and specialty certifications listed: CRS, ABR, GRI, SRES, SRS',
    'Transaction volume quantified: dollar amount, number of closings, and year',
    'Performance metrics included: list-to-sale ratio, average days on market, ranking within brokerage',
    'Market specialization defined: geography, property type, price range, or client segment',

  commonMistakes: [
    'Claiming "top producer" or "top agent" without supporting numbers — brokerages see this constantly and dismiss unquantified claims immediately.',
    'Listing every property you have ever sold instead of summarizing production with aggregate metrics and highlighting 2-3 notable transactions.',
    'Omitting license type and number — brokerages must verify licensing before onboarding, and missing this information slows the process.',
    'Focusing on duties ("showed properties, held open houses, wrote offers") instead of outcomes (volume closed, price achieved, days on market).',
    'Neglecting to mention CRM and technology experience — tech-forward brokerages filter out agents who cannot demonstrate platform proficiency.',
