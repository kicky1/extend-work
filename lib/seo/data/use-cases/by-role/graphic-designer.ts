    'Showcase your creative expertise, brand thinking, and technical proficiency with a resume that is itself a testament to your design skills — while still passing ATS screening.',

  keyTakeaways: [
    'Your portfolio link is the single most important element on your resume — place it in the header alongside your contact information and make sure it works.',
    'Balance creative formatting with ATS compatibility: use a clean layout that reflects design sensibility without breaking automated parsing.',
    'Quantify your design impact through business metrics — conversion rate lifts, engagement increases, brand recognition scores — not just deliverable counts.',
    'Specify your Adobe Creative Suite proficiency (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, After Effects) and any emerging tools like Figma, Sketch, or Canva Pro.',

      title: 'Presenting Your Portfolio Effectively',
      body: `<p>For graphic designers, the resume opens the door but the <strong>portfolio closes the deal</strong>. How you present and link to your work from your resume is critical.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Header placement:</strong> Include your portfolio URL in the header alongside your email and phone number. Use a clean, memorable URL — "janedoedesign.com" not "behance.net/user38291."</li>
  <li><strong>Curate ruthlessly:</strong> Your portfolio should contain 8-12 of your strongest projects, not everything you've ever made. Quality over quantity signals maturity.</li>
  <li><strong>Project context:</strong> For each portfolio piece, include the brief, your process, and the business result. "Redesigned the e-commerce landing page, increasing add-to-cart rate by 23%."</li>
  <li><strong>Platform choice:</strong> Behance and Dribbble are industry-standard platforms, but a custom portfolio site demonstrates web design capability and personal brand investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you reference specific projects in your resume bullets, hyperlink them directly to the corresponding portfolio case study. Recruiters who are intrigued by a metric will click through to see the work.</p>`,
      tip: 'Test your portfolio link on mobile before submitting — over 40% of recruiters do initial screening on their phones, and a portfolio that doesn\'t load on mobile is a missed opportunity.',

      title: 'Balancing Creativity and ATS Compatibility',
      body: `<p>The graphic designer's resume paradox: you need to demonstrate visual skill through your resume's design while ensuring it can be parsed by Applicant Tracking Systems that strip formatting.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Subtle design, not flashy:</strong> Use one accent color, consistent typography, and clean alignment to show design thinking without overwhelming ATS parsers.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid text in images:</strong> ATS cannot read text embedded in graphics. Your name, job titles, skills, and experience must all be in selectable text.</li>
  <li><strong>Standard section headings:</strong> Use conventional labels — "Experience," "Skills," "Education" — not creative alternatives like "My Journey" or "Toolbox." ATS looks for standard headings.</li>
  <li><strong>Two-version strategy:</strong> Create a beautifully designed PDF version for human reviewers and a stripped-down, ATS-optimized version for online application portals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your resume itself is a design sample. A clean, well-typeset resume with thoughtful whitespace and hierarchy demonstrates more design skill than a resume overloaded with graphics, gradients, and decorative elements.</p>`,
      tip: 'If you use a two-column layout, ensure the left column contains the primary content (experience, skills) and the right column holds secondary info (contact, tools, languages). ATS typically reads left-to-right, top-to-bottom.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Quantifying Design Impact with Business Metrics',
      body: `<p>Many designers describe their work in terms of deliverables — "designed 50 social media posts" — but hiring managers want to see <strong>business outcomes</strong>. Connect your design work to measurable impact.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Conversion:</strong> "Redesigned the product packaging for 3 SKUs, contributing to a 15% increase in shelf sales within the first quarter."</li>
  <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> "Created a brand identity system for a fintech startup that increased social media engagement by 180% within 6 months of launch."</li>
  <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> "Developed a modular design system with 200+ reusable components, reducing campaign design time by 40% across the marketing team."</li>
  <li><strong>Scale:</strong> "Produced visual assets for a product launch campaign reaching 4.2M impressions across digital, print, and out-of-home channels."</li>
  <li><strong>Brand consistency:</strong> "Authored a 60-page brand guidelines document adopted across 5 regional offices, reducing off-brand asset creation by 85%."</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't have direct access to business metrics, ask your marketing or product team for the numbers. Alternatively, reference the scope: number of deliverables, deadlines met, client satisfaction scores, or stakeholder approval rates.</p>`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Technical Skills and Software Proficiency',
      body: `<p>Your tools section tells hiring managers whether you can hit the ground running. Be specific about your proficiency level and the context in which you use each tool.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Adobe Creative Suite:</strong> Photoshop (photo editing, compositing), Illustrator (vector illustration, logo design), InDesign (editorial layout, print production), After Effects (motion graphics), Premiere Pro (video editing).</li>
  <li><strong>UI/UX tools:</strong> Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD — increasingly expected even for traditional graphic designers as the line between print and digital blurs.</li>
  <li><strong>Print production:</strong> Prepress preparation, color management (Pantone, CMYK profiles), bleed and trim specifications, vendor liaison for large-format and offset printing.</li>
  <li><strong>Emerging skills:</strong> 3D rendering (Blender, Cinema 4D), AR/VR asset creation, AI-assisted design workflows (Midjourney, Adobe Firefly for ideation).</li>
  <li><strong>Project and asset management:</strong> Asana, Monday.com, Trello for workflow; Google Drive, Dropbox, Brandfolder, or DAM systems for asset management.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organize your skills by category rather than dumping them in a single list. A well-structured skills section mirrors the organizational thinking that defines strong design work.</p>`,
      tip: 'If the job posting mentions Figma but you primarily use Sketch, don\'t just list Sketch — note your cross-platform capability: "Proficient in Sketch; working knowledge of Figma with collaborative project experience."',
    },
    {
      title: 'Showcasing Print, Digital, and Brand Identity Range',
      body: `<p>Graphic design spans a wide spectrum of specializations. Your resume should make your <strong>primary focus</strong> clear while demonstrating range where relevant.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Brand identity:</strong> Logo design, visual identity systems, brand guidelines, naming and verbal identity collaboration. "Developed the complete visual identity for a Series A startup — logo, color palette, typography, and a 40-page brand book."</li>
  <li><strong>Print design:</strong> Packaging, editorial layout, large-format signage, trade show materials, direct mail. Include your knowledge of print production processes.</li>
  <li><strong>Digital design:</strong> Web graphics, email templates, social media assets, digital ad creative, motion graphics. Reference platforms and specs (Instagram, Google Display, responsive email).</li>
  <li><strong>UX/UI crossover:</strong> If you've designed interfaces, wireframes, or prototypes, include these as they significantly broaden your candidacy. "Designed the mobile app onboarding flow in Figma, tested with 12 users, and iterated through 3 rounds."</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're a generalist, use your professional summary to state your breadth. If you're a specialist, go deep — hiring managers looking for a packaging designer want to see volume and variety within that niche, not scattered unrelated projects.</p>`,
    },
  ],
  checklist: [
    'Portfolio URL prominently placed in the header with a clean, professional domain',
    'Professional summary states your design specialization and years of experience',
    'Adobe Creative Suite proficiency listed with specific applications and use cases',
    'At least 3 resume bullets connect design work to business metrics (conversion, engagement, efficiency)',
    'Technical skills organized by category: design software, UI/UX tools, print production, emerging skills',
    'Experience section names specific brands, campaigns, or products you worked on',
    'Two resume versions prepared: ATS-compatible for portals and designed PDF for direct submissions',
    'All text is selectable — no critical information embedded in images or graphics',
    'Education includes design degree and any relevant continuing education (typography, UX, motion)',
    'Resume formatting itself demonstrates clean design thinking: hierarchy, whitespace, consistent typography',
  ],
  commonMistakes: [
    'Omitting a portfolio link or burying it at the bottom of the resume — without a visible, working portfolio link, most design resumes are immediately discarded.',
    'Over-designing the resume with heavy graphics, backgrounds, and decorative elements that make ATS parsing impossible and distract from the content.',
    'Listing deliverable counts ("designed 200 social posts") without connecting them to business outcomes like engagement growth, conversion improvement, or campaign reach.',
    'Failing to specify print production knowledge (bleed, trim, color profiles) for roles that involve physical deliverables — this is a core competency that separates professional designers from amateurs.',
    'Using only Adobe Creative Suite when the role requires Figma or other collaborative tools — not showing adaptability to modern, team-based design workflows can be disqualifying.',
