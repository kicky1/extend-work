  metaDescription:
    'Create a physical therapist resume that highlights clinical specializations, patient outcomes, and evidence-based practice. Covers licensure, documentation skills, and ATS optimization.',
  subtitle:
    'Translate your clinical expertise, patient outcome data, and specialized certifications into a resume that lands you the right position in any practice setting.',
  readTimeMinutes: 9,
  keyTakeaways: [
    'Place your DPT degree, state licensure, and board certifications (OCS, NCS, SCS, PCS) directly after your name — these are the first things hiring managers verify.',
    'Quantify patient outcomes with functional improvement scores, discharge rates, patient satisfaction metrics, and caseload volume rather than listing duties.',
    'Tailor your resume to the practice setting: outpatient orthopedic, acute care, inpatient rehab, home health, pediatric, and neurological each require different emphasis.',
    'Highlight evidence-based practice, continuing education, and any clinical instruction or mentorship roles that demonstrate professional growth.',

    {
      title: 'Presenting Licensure, Credentials, and Specializations',
      body: `<p>In physical therapy, licensure is a non-negotiable prerequisite and board certifications signal advanced expertise. Make both <strong>immediately visible</strong> on your resume.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Header format:</strong> "Dr. Maria Rodriguez, PT, DPT, OCS" — include your degree and all active board certifications after your name. Use the APTA-recognized credential order: PT, DPT/MPT, board certifications, other credentials.</li>
  <li><strong>Licensure section:</strong> Create a dedicated section listing your state PT license with license number, state, and status. If you are licensed in multiple states, list all — multi-state licensure is a significant advantage, especially for travel PT or telehealth roles.</li>
  <li><strong>Board certifications:</strong> ABPTS certifications (OCS, NCS, SCS, PCS, GCS, CCS, ECS, WCS) demonstrate specialist-level expertise. Include the certification body and year obtained.</li>
  <li><strong>Additional credentials:</strong> List relevant certifications like Certified Dry Needling, McKenzie MDT Credentialed, LSVT BIG Certified, Certified Lymphedema Therapist (CLT), or Certified Vestibular Therapist.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are a new graduate, your DPT program accreditation matters. Mention CAPTE accreditation if your program is well-regarded. For experienced PTs, credentials and outcomes speak louder than where you went to school.</p>`,
      tip: 'If you hold an ABPTS board certification, place it prominently — only about 10% of physical therapists hold one, and it immediately distinguishes you from other candidates.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Quantifying Patient Outcomes and Clinical Impact',
      body: `<p>Physical therapy resumes too often default to duty-based descriptions: "Evaluated and treated patients with orthopedic conditions." This tells hiring managers nothing distinctive. Instead, <strong>quantify your clinical effectiveness</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Functional outcomes:</strong> "Achieved average patient functional improvement of 85% on the LEFS (Lower Extremity Functional Scale) across a caseload of 60+ patients per week in an outpatient orthopedic setting."</li>
  <li><strong>Discharge rates:</strong> "Maintained a 92% rate of patients meeting all discharge goals within the authorized visit count, reducing re-referral rates by 18%."</li>
  <li><strong>Patient satisfaction:</strong> "Consistently achieved 4.9/5.0 patient satisfaction scores across 300+ annual surveys, ranking in the top 5% of clinicians in a 40-provider practice."</li>
  <li><strong>Productivity and caseload:</strong> "Managed a caseload of 14-16 patients per day in an outpatient setting while maintaining 95% documentation completion within 24 hours."</li>
</ul>
<p>If your facility tracks outcomes using standardized measures (FOTO, DASH, ODI, NDI, Berg Balance Scale), reference those specific tools. Familiarity with outcomes tracking systems signals clinical rigor and data-driven practice.</p>`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Highlighting Clinical Specializations and Techniques',
      body: `<p>Your clinical skills section should be specific to your practice area and use the terminology that hiring managers and ATS systems search for in your specialty.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Orthopedic:</strong> Manual therapy, joint mobilization/manipulation, therapeutic exercise prescription, post-surgical rehabilitation (ACL, rotator cuff, total joint), dry needling, instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM), kinesiology taping.</li>
  <li><strong>Neurological:</strong> Neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT), proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF), locomotor training, constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), vestibular rehabilitation, balance and fall prevention programs.</li>
  <li><strong>Acute care:</strong> ICU mobilization, ventilator weaning, cardiac rehabilitation, post-surgical mobilization, wound care, amputation rehabilitation, assistive device training.</li>
  <li><strong>Pediatric:</strong> Developmental assessment, torticollis management, cerebral palsy intervention, sensory integration, orthotic management, adaptive equipment prescription, school-based therapy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Include documentation system proficiency: WebPT, Clinicient, Net Health (ReDoc), Therapy Source, or Epic Rehab. EMR fluency directly impacts productivity and is a genuine hiring consideration, especially in larger health systems.</p>`,
      tip: 'Mirror the exact language from the job posting. If they say "manual therapy techniques," do not write "hands-on treatment." If they say "evidence-based interventions," use that exact phrase. ATS matching is often literal.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Showcasing Leadership, Teaching, and Professional Development',
      body: `<p>Physical therapy employers value clinicians who contribute beyond direct patient care. Leadership and teaching activities demonstrate professional maturity and readiness for senior or supervisory roles.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clinical instruction:</strong> "Served as Clinical Instructor (CI) for 6 DPT students over 3 years, with all students receiving 'entry-level' or above ratings on the CPI (Clinical Performance Instrument) at midterm."</li>
  <li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> "Mentored 4 new graduate PTs through their first year of practice, including treatment planning, documentation efficiency, and caseload management."</li>
  <li><strong>Program development:</strong> "Designed and launched a pelvic health physical therapy program, growing the service line from 0 to 40 patients per week within 12 months and generating $280K in annual revenue."</li>
  <li><strong>In-services and education:</strong> "Presented 8 in-service trainings to the rehabilitation department on topics including fall prevention screening, vestibular assessment, and dry needling indications."</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuing education is expected in PT — but strategic CE choices differentiate you. Completing an orthopedic residency, earning a fellowship, or pursuing advanced manual therapy certification (FAAOMPT) signals deeper commitment than generic CEU courses.</p>`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Education, Residency, and Continuing Education',
      body: `<p>Physical therapy has a clear educational pathway, and presenting it correctly ensures hiring managers can quickly verify your qualifications.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DPT degree:</strong> List your Doctor of Physical Therapy degree, institution, and graduation year. If you graduated from a program known for a particular specialty (orthopedic, neurological, sports), that context can be valuable.</li>
  <li><strong>Residency and fellowship:</strong> If you completed an APTA-accredited clinical residency or fellowship, feature it prominently — residency-trained PTs are a small, highly sought-after group. Include the specialty, institution, and year.</li>
  <li><strong>Key continuing education:</strong> List the most advanced and relevant courses, not every CEU workshop. "Maitland Australian Physiotherapy Seminars — Levels I through IV" is more impressive than a long list of weekend seminars.</li>
  <li><strong>Research and publications:</strong> If you have published case studies, participated in clinical research, or presented at APTA conferences (CSM, NEXT), include a brief scholarly activity section.</li>
</ul>
<p>For experienced PTs, education should appear after your clinical experience section. For new graduates or residency completers, placing education and residency near the top makes sense because it is currently your strongest differentiator.</p>`,
      tip: 'If you are a new graduate, list your clinical affiliations under education with the setting type and patient population. "Clinical Affiliation: Level I Trauma Center, acute care and ICU mobilization, 12 weeks" adds valuable context that compensates for limited professional experience.',

    'Listing every CEU course completed instead of curating for advanced, specialty-relevant training that differentiates you.',
    'Omitting EMR system experience — clinics invest in specific platforms and strongly prefer therapists who can be productive from day one.',
    'Failing to tailor clinical skills to the specific practice setting — orthopedic, neurological, acute care, and pediatric PT require completely different skill emphasis.',
