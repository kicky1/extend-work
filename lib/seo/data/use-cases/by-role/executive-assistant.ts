      title: 'Leading with Executive Support Experience',
      body: `<p>The most important information on an executive assistant resume is <strong>who you supported and at what organizational level</strong>. Hiring managers use this as a proxy for the complexity and confidentiality of your work.</p>
<p>In your professional summary and experience section, clearly state:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Executive title(s):</strong> "Provided direct support to the CEO, COO, and General Counsel at a Series D fintech startup with 400+ employees."</li>
  <li><strong>Company size and type:</strong> Supporting a C-suite executive at a Fortune 500 company requires a fundamentally different skill set than supporting a startup founder. Make the context explicit.</li>
  <li><strong>Scope of responsibility:</strong> "Managed all aspects of daily operations for a 3-person C-suite including calendar management, board meeting preparation, investor relations coordination, and international travel logistics."</li>
  <li><strong>Reporting structure:</strong> If you supervised other administrative staff, specify the team size — "Oversaw a team of 4 administrative coordinators across 2 office locations."</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid generic titles like "administrative assistant" in your resume header if your actual role was executive-level support. Use "Executive Assistant to the CEO" or "Senior Executive Assistant" to accurately represent your position.</p>`,
      tip: 'If you signed an NDA that prevents naming your employer, describe the company by industry, revenue range, and employee count instead — "Fortune 200 healthcare company with $15B in annual revenue."',
    },
    {
      title: 'Quantifying Calendar, Travel, and Event Management',
      body: `<p>Calendar management, travel logistics, and event coordination are core EA competencies, but listing them as duties adds no value. Instead, <strong>quantify the complexity and scale</strong> of what you managed to differentiate yourself from less experienced candidates.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Calendar management:</strong> "Managed a CEO calendar averaging 45+ meetings per week across 4 time zones, achieving a 98% on-time meeting start rate through proactive conflict resolution and buffer management."</li>
  <li><strong>Travel coordination:</strong> "Coordinated 60+ international trips annually to 15+ countries, including visa procurement, ground transportation, and backup itineraries. Reduced travel spend by 18% ($85K annually) through vendor negotiations and policy optimization."</li>
  <li><strong>Event planning:</strong> "Planned and executed quarterly board meetings for a 12-member board, managing $150K in annual event budgets, venue contracts, catering, and board book preparation."</li>
  <li><strong>Off-site coordination:</strong> "Organized a 200-person company retreat with a $300K budget, handling venue selection, speaker coordination, team-building activities, and post-event feedback collection."</li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics transform generic responsibilities into concrete evidence of your capability. A hiring manager reading "coordinated 60+ international trips annually" immediately understands you can handle their executive's travel demands.</p>`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Demonstrating Technology and Systems Proficiency',
      body: `<p>Modern executive assistants are expected to be power users of productivity tools, communication platforms, and enterprise software. Your technology proficiency section should go beyond listing software names — it should convey <strong>advanced capabilities</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Productivity suites:</strong> Microsoft 365 (advanced Excel including pivot tables, VLOOKUP, macros; PowerPoint deck design; Outlook calendar and inbox management) and Google Workspace (Sheets, Slides, advanced Calendar features, Apps Script automations).</li>
  <li><strong>Communication platforms:</strong> Slack (workspace administration, channel management, workflow builder), Zoom (webinar hosting, room configuration), Microsoft Teams.</li>
  <li><strong>Expense and travel tools:</strong> Concur, Expensify, Navan (TripActions), Egencia — include experience with expense report reconciliation and policy compliance.</li>
  <li><strong>Project and task management:</strong> Asana, Monday.com, Trello, Notion — describe how you used these tools to track executive priorities, manage cross-functional projects, or coordinate leadership team OKRs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've built process automations, created executive dashboards, or implemented new tools for your leadership team, these accomplishments belong in your experience bullets, not just the skills section. "Built an automated expense reporting workflow in Concur that reduced executive reimbursement time from 12 days to 3" demonstrates tech-savviness and initiative.</p>`,
      tip: 'Mention your typing speed and any virtual assistant or AI tool proficiency (ChatGPT for drafting, Otter.ai for meeting notes, Calendly for scheduling) — these are increasingly sought after.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Showcasing Discretion, Communication, and Stakeholder Management',
      body: `<p>Executive assistants operate at the intersection of confidential information, high-stakes communication, and competing stakeholder demands. Your resume should demonstrate that you possess the <strong>judgment and emotional intelligence</strong> required for this trusted role.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Confidential communications:</strong> "Managed all confidential correspondence for the CEO during a $2B acquisition process, coordinating with external legal counsel, investment bankers, and board members under strict information barriers."</li>
  <li><strong>Stakeholder management:</strong> "Served as primary point of contact between the C-suite and 200+ employees, board members, investors, and external partners, ensuring timely and professional communication across all channels."</li>
  <li><strong>Cross-department liaison:</strong> "Coordinated executive priorities across Marketing, Finance, Product, and Engineering departments, facilitating weekly leadership alignment meetings and tracking action items to completion."</li>
  <li><strong>Crisis management:</strong> "Managed executive communications and logistics during office relocation, COVID-19 transition to remote work, and two executive leadership transitions without disruption to operations."</li>
</ul>
<p>Use language that conveys partnership rather than task execution. "Partnered with the CEO to prepare for board presentations" is stronger than "Created PowerPoint slides for board meetings." The distinction matters — it signals that you operate as a strategic partner, not just a task taker.</p>`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Formatting and Presentation for EA Resumes',
      body: `<p>Your resume is a direct reflection of the organizational skills and attention to detail that define the EA role. Formatting mistakes on an executive assistant resume are particularly damaging because they undermine the very competencies you're claiming to possess.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use a polished, professional layout with consistent formatting, clean alignment, and ample white space. Your resume should look like a document you'd confidently hand to a CEO.</li>
  <li>Keep your resume to one page unless you have 15+ years of experience supporting senior executives. Concision is an EA superpower — demonstrate it.</li>
  <li>Lead your professional summary with the highest-level executive you've supported and the most impressive organizational context.</li>
  <li>Include a "Technology Proficiency" section organized by category rather than a flat list — it mirrors the organizational thinking expected in the role.</li>
</ul>
<p>Export as PDF and name the file meticulously: <code>FirstName_LastName_Executive_Assistant_Resume.pdf</code>. Proofread with extreme care — a single typo on an EA resume can be disqualifying, as it raises questions about your attention to detail in a role where details define success.</p>`,
      tip: 'Consider including a brief "Executive References Available" note at the bottom. EA hiring often relies heavily on references from previous executives, and signaling their availability demonstrates confidence in your track record.',

  commonMistakes: [
    'Failing to specify which executives you supported and at what organizational level — "Supported senior leadership" is vague; "EA to CEO and CFO at a $500M SaaS company" is compelling.',
    'Listing duties instead of achievements — "Managed travel" says nothing; "Coordinated 80+ international trips annually while reducing travel spend by 22%" demonstrates impact.',
    'Underrepresenting technology skills or listing only basic proficiency — modern EAs are expected to be advanced users of productivity suites, not just familiar with them.',
    'Using a generic administrative assistant resume format instead of positioning yourself as a strategic executive partner — language matters in how hiring managers perceive your level.',
    'Neglecting to mention confidentiality and discretion — these are foundational EA competencies, and their absence raises concerns about your suitability for sensitive roles.',
