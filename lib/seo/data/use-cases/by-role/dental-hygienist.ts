      title: 'Presenting RDH Licensure and Clinical Credentials',
      body: `<p>Dental hygiene is a licensed healthcare profession, and your credentials are the first thing a hiring dentist checks. They must be <strong>impossible to overlook</strong> in the first seconds of review.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place credentials after your name in the header: "Amanda Chen, RDH, BS, RDHAP." If you hold an expanded practice permit (RDHAP in California, IPDH in other states), include it — it signals scope-of-practice flexibility.</li>
  <li>Create a "Licensure & Certifications" section listing: active RDH license with state and number, local anesthesia administration permit, nitrous oxide monitoring certification, CPR/BLS certification, and any additional credentials.</li>
  <li>If you hold licenses in multiple states, list all of them. Multi-state licensure is especially valuable for practices near state borders and for temp/travel hygienist positions.</li>
  <li>Include laser certification (diode laser for soft tissue procedures), if applicable. Laser-certified hygienists are in high demand as more practices adopt laser-assisted periodontal therapy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Distinguish between your degree (AS, BS, MS in Dental Hygiene) and your licensure (RDH). Both matter: the degree for career advancement opportunities, the license for clinical practice authorization. Never conflate them.</p>`,
      tip: 'If you graduated from a CODA-accredited program, mention it. Some states have additional requirements for graduates of non-accredited programs, so CODA accreditation removes a potential concern for hiring dentists.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Quantifying Clinical Performance and Patient Outcomes',
      body: `<p>Most dental hygienist resumes default to listing procedures: "Performed scaling, root planing, and prophylaxis." Every RDH does these things. What hiring dentists want to see is <strong>your measurable impact on the practice and patient health</strong>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Patient volume:</strong> "Maintained a full hygiene schedule of 8-10 patients per day across 4 clinical days, generating an average of $1,800 in daily hygiene production."</li>
  <li><strong>Recare retention:</strong> "Achieved a 92% recare appointment retention rate through proactive patient communication and personalized recall scheduling, exceeding the practice benchmark of 80%."</li>
  <li><strong>Periodontal treatment acceptance:</strong> "Increased periodontal treatment acceptance from 55% to 78% by implementing structured case presentations with intraoral photography and patient education materials."</li>
  <li><strong>Perio program development:</strong> "Established a formal periodontal maintenance program for the practice, transitioning 120+ patients from prophylaxis to appropriate perio maintenance intervals based on AAP guidelines."</li>
  <li><strong>Sealant and fluoride programs:</strong> "Implemented a pediatric sealant program resulting in 200+ sealant placements annually and a measurable reduction in caries incidence among the practice's pediatric population."</li>
</ul>
<p>If the practice grew its hygiene department during your tenure — added operatories, hired additional hygienists, extended hygiene hours — note it. Practice growth attributable to hygiene production is a powerful credential.</p>`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Showcasing Clinical Skills and Specialty Experience',
      body: `<p>Your clinical skills section must go beyond the basics to reflect <strong>the full scope of your training and any specialty experience</strong> that distinguishes you from other candidates.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Assessment and diagnosis:</strong> Comprehensive periodontal charting (6-point probing), oral cancer screening, caries risk assessment (CAMBRA), nutritional counseling for oral health, tobacco cessation counseling.</li>
  <li><strong>Instrumentation:</strong> Hand scaling and root planing, ultrasonic scaling (Cavitron, Piezo), air polishing (Prophy-Jet, Air-Flow), hand instrument sharpening. Note proficiency with both Gracey and universal curettes.</li>
  <li><strong>Radiography:</strong> Digital radiography (periapical, bitewing, panoramic), CBCT operation and interpretation, sensor placement techniques, radiation safety protocols. Specify systems: Dexis, Schick, Carestream, Planmeca.</li>
  <li><strong>Expanded functions:</strong> Local anesthesia administration (infiltration and block injections), nitrous oxide sedation monitoring, temporary restoration placement, sealant application, coronal polishing, impressions for study models and whitening trays.</li>
  <li><strong>Specialty experience:</strong> If you have worked in periodontics, pediatric dentistry, orthodontics, or oral surgery, detail the specialty-specific procedures you performed. "Assisted in guided tissue regeneration and bone graft procedures in a periodontal specialty practice."</li>
</ul>
<p>Scope of practice varies by state. When listing expanded functions, ensure they are within the legal scope for the state where you are applying. A dentist in Texas will question why you list local anesthesia administration if their state just recently authorized it.</p>`,
      tip: 'If you are trained in laser-assisted periodontal therapy (LANAP protocol, diode laser bacterial reduction), highlight it separately. Laser skills are a premium differentiator that many practices will pay more for.',
    },
    {
      title: 'Demonstrating Technology and Dental Software Proficiency',
      body: `<p>Modern dental practices run on software and digital workflows. Hiring dentists want hygienists who can <strong>operate the technology stack without extensive training</strong> during onboarding.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Practice management software:</strong> Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Open Dental, Curve Dental, Denticon (DSO platform), SoftDent. Specify modules you use: scheduling, charting, treatment planning, insurance verification, patient communication.</li>
  <li><strong>Digital imaging:</strong> Dexis sensors, Schick sensors, Carestream, Planmeca ProMax (panoramic/CBCT), iTero intraoral scanner, 3Shape TRIOS. "Captured digital impressions using iTero for Invisalign case submissions and whitening tray fabrication."</li>
  <li><strong>Patient communication platforms:</strong> Lighthouse 360, RevenueWell, Weave, Solutionreach, Modento. "Managed patient recalls and confirmations through Weave, maintaining a 92% confirmation rate for hygiene appointments."</li>
  <li><strong>Intraoral cameras and documentation:</strong> Specify camera systems used and how you integrated photography into case acceptance workflows. "Used DEXIS intraoral camera to document periodontal conditions, increasing SRP case acceptance by 23%."</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have experience with DSO (Dental Service Organization) platforms and workflows — Heartland, Aspen, Pacific Dental Services — mention it. DSO experience demonstrates your ability to work within standardized clinical protocols and production tracking systems.</p>`,
    },
    {
      title: 'Highlighting Patient Education and Continuing Education',
      body: `<p>Patient education is where dental hygienists have the greatest long-term impact on oral health outcomes. Hiring dentists value hygienists who go beyond cleaning teeth to <strong>actively educate and motivate patients</strong> toward better home care.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Patient education initiatives:</strong> "Developed and presented chairside oral hygiene instruction customized to patient age, dexterity, and risk factors, resulting in measurable improvements in plaque scores at recare appointments."</li>
  <li><strong>Community outreach:</strong> "Organized and delivered oral health education programs at 3 local elementary schools, reaching 400+ students annually with age-appropriate oral hygiene instruction and free fluoride varnish application."</li>
  <li><strong>Continuing education:</strong> "Completed 60+ CE hours beyond state requirements over 3 years, focusing on periodontal disease management, laser therapy, and myofunctional therapy."</li>
  <li><strong>Infection control expertise:</strong> "Served as the practice's infection control coordinator, maintaining OSHA compliance, managing sterilization logs, and conducting quarterly staff training on PPE protocols and instrument processing."</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are pursuing advanced education — a Bachelor's or Master's in Dental Hygiene, public health, or education — include it. Advanced degrees position you for roles in education, public health, corporate training, and practice management beyond the operatory.</p>`,
      tip: 'If you hold specialty CE credentials like a certificate in orofacial myology, sleep dentistry screening, or geriatric oral health, list them. These niche specializations are increasingly valued as practices expand their service offerings.',

  checklist: [
    'RDH credential and state licensure displayed after name in resume header',

  commonMistakes: [
    'Listing procedures without context or outcomes — "performed prophylaxis and scaling" tells a hiring dentist nothing they do not already assume about every RDH candidate.',
    'Omitting production numbers. Dentists hire hygienists partly based on revenue generation. If you consistently produce $1,500-2,000+ per day, that belongs on your resume.',
    'Burying licensure and credentials in a skills section instead of making them immediately visible in the header and a dedicated section.',
    'Failing to list dental software experience — practices using Dentrix do not want to train a new hire on Dentrix from scratch if they can hire someone already proficient.',
    'Not mentioning infection control or OSHA compliance experience, which is a non-negotiable responsibility that every dental practice takes seriously.',
